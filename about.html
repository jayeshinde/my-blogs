Hi, I'm Jayesh and I create all the stuff you see on the site. 
I'm a(mostly) self-taugh software engineer, who loves coding and helping people to code. 
I'm obessed with: my camera, wife, son and building art with JavaScript.

###My Goal: 
I want to make learning to code more accessible and fun for everyone. I have years of professional and progreamming experience, and I want to use it to help you be the best programmer you can be.

##### Writing blogs on technologies I learn has completly changed my life!

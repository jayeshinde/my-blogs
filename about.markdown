Hi, I'm **Jayesh** and I create all the stuff you see on the site.
I'm a(mostly) **self-taugh** software engineer, who loves coding and helping people to code. 
> I'm obessed with: *my camera, wife, son* and building art with JavaScript.

### My Goal: 
- I want to make learning to code more accessible and fun for everyone. 
- I have years of professional and progreamming experience, and I want to use it to help you be the best programmer you can be.
